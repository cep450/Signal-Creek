//Poster of Sailors Uranus and Neptune [heavily implied queer couple]
//Nour makes a passing comment about how she always felt a wonderful sense of giddiness when she would see Sailor Uranus in a suit, or when their gender became unclear.

//IF VISITED IN REAL
NOUR: Yeah, that's more like it! Uranus and Neptune together- Oh, I love when they subvert gender roles. And when Uranus would wear a suit, man, I thought she looked so cool....

//IF NOT VISITED IN REAL
NOUR: No way! Finally, some Sailor Moon merchandise with Uranus and Neptune!
