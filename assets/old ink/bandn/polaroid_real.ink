//the polaroid file
//This was the first polaroid camera Nour had. Her parents bought it for her when she first started showing interest in photography, since her mother's family had one when she was young.

NOUR: The film in this must be completely useless by now. 

NOUR: Who knows how long it's been sitting here.

NOUR: It's the polaroid again. Looks pretty f-ed up, though.
